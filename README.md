## Nine Key Business Metrics for CSMs
Know what they are, how they are calculated and how they are used

1. Annual Recurring Revenue - ARR - tracks recurring revenue on an annual basis.  ARR is the value of recurring revenue from customers.  Monthly recurring revenue (MRR).  Measures "locked-in" subscription revenue collected montly or annually
      - 100 customers paying $1000/month MRR: 100 X $1000/mo = $100,000  ARR: $12,000/per customer annually x 100 customers = $1,200,000
2. Upsell and expansion revenue.  Upsell net new revenue when they purchase new software/services.  Expansion revenue is when they buy more of the same project.
3. Retention and Churn.  Revenue can go down through churn.  Retention measure how much revenue is retained during a period of time.  Churn measures how much revenue is lost.
4. Logo Rentention.  THe number of customers accounts still active at the end of a period divide by the number active at the beggining of the period.
5. Gross Revenue Retention (GRR) - GRR the % of revenue from a pool of customers that is still present at the end of a specified period, not including expansion or upsell revenue
6. Net Revenue Retention - Measures the net revenue left over from a pool of customers that are still active in a period this include subsription retirment (downgrading) as well as expansion and upsell revenue.  Above 100% is good.  If below 60% may indicate issues.  THis looks at revenue with no new customers.
7. Annual Contract Value (ACV) - The annual contract value of a subscription agreement not including services or training
8. Total contact value = TCV- counts subscriptions, services, training and multiple year subscription
9. Average Revenue per unit - ARPU - R-poo  ARR/by number of customers
10. Customer acquisition cost and lifetime value - CAC and CLTV.  Customer acquisition cost is total cost of sales and marketing to acquire a customer.  A CAC should be lower than CLTV in general.  CLTV or LTV is a prediction of net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer.  CLTV/CAC should be greater than 3 to see a healthy business.
